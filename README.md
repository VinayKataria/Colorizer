COLORIZING AND RESTORING OLD IMAGES AND VIDEOS </br>
Abstract</br>
We propose a deep learning & ML approach for user-guided image colorization and restoration. The system
directly maps a grayscale image, along with sparse, local user "hints" to an output colorization and
restoration with a Generative adversarial networks(GAN). Rather than using hand-defined rules, the network
propagates user edits by fusing low-level cues along with high-level semantic information, learned from
large-scale data. We train on a hundreds of images, with simulated user inputs. To guide the project towards
efficient input selection, the system recommends likely colors based on the input image and current user
inputs. The colorization and restoration is performed in a single feed-forward pass, enabling real-time use.
Even with randomly simulated user inputs, we show that the proposed system helps novice users quickly
create realistic colorizations, and show large improvements in colorization and restoration quality with just a
minute of use. In addition, we show that the framework can incorporate other user "hints" as to the desired
colorization, showing an application to color histogram transfer.

 ABOUT OUR PROJECT
 </br>
Simply put, the mission of this
project is to colorize and restore
old images and film footage. We'll
get into the details in a bit, but first
let's see some pretty pictures and
videos!
</br>
Strengths Very Good in making old images and videos, black and white images and videos back to life and restorization.
</br>
Weaknesses Contrast level cann't be precise as we like.Opportunities There is always an opportunity to improve in
code and use of this code in major project for face reconzation with any type of image withaccurate output result.
What we able to Acheive from this Project
</br>
Glitches and artifacts are almost entirely eliminated</br>
Better skin (less zombies)</br>
More highly detailed and photorealistic renders</br>
Much less "blue bias"</br>
Video - it actually looks good!</br>
GAN - neural networks that generate material, such as images, music, speech, or text, that
is similar to what humans produce..</br>
Restoration of blur and fast image click images.
